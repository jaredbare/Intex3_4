                    For over 25 years, archeological investigations have been conducted at Fag el-Gamous, a significant cemetery in Egypt, primarily by
                    BYU researchers. This excavation has gained worldwide attention for the intriguing insights obtained from the study of the Fag el-Gamous
                    mummies. Throughout multiple years of study, researchers have excavated more than 1,000 mummies and collected a wealth of data in field
                    notes, spreadsheets, and simple databases. This information includes the mummy's physical orientation in the ground, burial depth, hair
                    color, wrapping, sex, age, bone dimensions, accompanying items, and more. Researchers have also performed a range of analyses on the
                    excavated items, including carbon dating and DNA sequencing. The "dig" is organized using a grid system that assigns a unique identifier
                    to each burial location, which typically contains 40 or more mummies.
